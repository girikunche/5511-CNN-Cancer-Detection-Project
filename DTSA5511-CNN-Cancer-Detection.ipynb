This is how doctors can tell that it is cancer that has spread from another part of the body.\n",

Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. This outer region is provided to enable fully-convolutional models that do not use zero-padding, to ensure consistent behavior when applied to a whole-slide image.\n"
